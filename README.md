# MyUniAIProjects
This repository contains two projects created for my AI course at university. The first project implements a genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The second project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify images from a fire dataset, focusing on fire detection for safety applications.
